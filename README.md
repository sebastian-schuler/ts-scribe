# TS-Scribe

A TypeScript library tailored for Node.js development. It offers utility functions and custom types to enhance productivity and improve code quality. Whether youâ€™re handling files, working with asynchronous operations, or ensuring type safety, ts-scribe provides valuable tools for your TypeScript projects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ts-scribe
```

## Functions

### Object Functions

- `deepEquals`: Deeply compares two objects or arrays.
- `deepMerge`: Deep merges multiple objects and gives accurate types.
- `deepClone`: Deep clones an object. It's a faster and more accurate alternative to `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`. (A type-safe wrapper for `rfdc`)

### Number Functions

- `isNumber`: Checks if any value is a number or can be parsed into a number.
- `clamp`: Clamps a number between a minimum and maximum value.

### String Functions

- `toCamelCase`: Converts a string to camelCase.
- `toKebabCase`: Converts a string to kebab-case.
- `toSnakeCase`: Converts a string to snake_case.
- `toDotCase`: Converts a string to dot.case.
- `toPascalCase`: Converts a string to PascalCase.
- `toHeaderCase`: Converts a string to Header Case.

### Promise Functions

- `debounced`: Debounces a promise.
- `maybe`: A Maybe monad is an immutable wrapper which allows you to defer handling of null/undefined values and errors until you want to capture the result of an operation. It's an alternative to frequent nullish checks and try/catch blocks.
- `retry`: Retries a promise a specified number of times.
- `semaphore`: Limits the number of promises that can be executed concurrently.

### Array Functions

Use the `ArrayUtils` class for these functions.

- `toArray`: Converts almost anything into an array.
- `powerset`: Returns the powerset of an array.
- `chunk`: Splits an array into chunks of a specified size.
- `difference`: Returns the difference between two arrays.
- `intersection`: Returns the intersection of two arrays.
- `pluck`: Extracts a list of property values from an array of objects.
- `groupBy`: Groups an array of objects by a specified key.

### List Classes

- `WeightedList`: A weighted list is a list where each element has a weight associated with it. The probability of an element being selected is proportional to its weight.
- `SortedList`: A sorted list is a list that maintains its elements in sorted order. It's useful for maintaining a list of elements that need to be sorted frequently.

### Utility Types

- `Mandatory`: Exclude nullish values from a type.
- `NonNullish`: Allows assignment of anything except nullish values.
- `Nullish`: Only allows assignment of anything nullish.
- `OverloadUnion`: Converts a union of functions into a single function with overloads.
- `Primitive`: JS primitive types.
- `Simplify`: If two or more types are intersected, it simplifies them into a single type for better readability.
- `SmartPartial`: The keys that allow undefined are optional, the rest are required.
- `TypeOfString`: Strings which can be used with `typeof` operator.
- `TypeOfType`: Infer the `typeof` type from a `typeof` string.
- `UnionToIntersection`: Convert a union type (`|`) to an intersection type (`&`).
- `GenericFunction`: A generic function type, useful for defining functions that accept any number of arguments and return any type. It's a stronger type than `Function`.
- `Nestable`: A type that can be nested infinitely. Used in deepEquals and arrIntersection functions.
