A TypeScript library tailored for Node.js development. It offers utility functions and custom types to enhance productivity and improve code quality. Whether youâ€™re handling files, working with asynchronous operations, or ensuring type safety, ts-scribe provides valuable tools for your TypeScript projects.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ts-scribe
```

## Functions

### Core

- `run`: Helper to run a function or block of code in a cleaner way.
- `parseBoolean`: Parses different kinds of values into a boolean.
- `parseNumber`: Parses different kinds of values into a number.

### Array

- `chunkArray`: Splits an array into chunks of a specified size.
- `differenceArray`: Returns the difference between two arrays.
- `groupBy`: Groups an array of objects by a specified key.
- `intersection`: Returns the intersection of two arrays.
- `pluckArray`: Extracts a list of property values from an array of objects.
- `powerset`: Returns the powerset of an array.
- `shuffleArray`: Shuffle an array.
- `toArray`: Converts almost anything into an array.
- `uniqueBy`: Returns an array of unique objects based on a specified key.

### Async

- `asyncForEach`: Asynchronous for each function running in parallel (behaving like Promise.all).
- `debounced`: Debounces a promise.
- `maybe`: A Maybe monad is an immutable wrapper which allows you to defer handling of null/undefined values and errors until you want to capture the result of an operation. It's an alternative to frequent nullish checks and try/catch blocks.
- `retry`: Retries a promise a specified number of times.
- `semaphore`: Limits the number of promises that can be executed concurrently.
- `sleep`: Pause the process for a certain amount of time.
- `waterfall`: Runs an array of functions in series, each passing their results to the next in the array.

### List

- `WeightedList`: A list where each element has a weight associated with it. The probability of an element being selected is proportional to its weight.
- `SortedList`: A list that maintains its elements in sorted order. It's useful for maintaining a list of elements that need to be sorted frequently.

### Math

- `clamp`: Clamps a number between a minimum and maximum value.
- `greatestCommonDivisor`: Compute the greatest common divisor between any amount of numbers.
- `smallestCommonMultiple`: Compute the smallest common multiple between any amount of numbers.

### Object

- `deepClone`: Deep clones an object. It's a faster and more accurate alternative to `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`.
- `deepEquals`: Deeply compares two objects or arrays.
- `deepFreeze`: Deeply freeze an object.
- `deepMerge`: Deep merges multiple objects and gives accurate types.
- `safeJsonParse`: Parse a Json string safely.
- `pruneObject`: Removes all properties with undefined values from an object.
- `removeKeys`: Removes keys from an object.
- `flattenObject`: Flattens an object. You can specify the separator.

### Random

- `randomString`: Generates a random string. You can specify the length and character set.
- `randomInt`: Generates a random integer. You can specify the minimum and maximum values.
- `randomBool`: Generates a random boolean. You can specify the probability of getting `true`.
- `randomSample`: Returns random elements from an array. You can specify the number of elements to return.

### String

- `toCamelCase`: Converts a string to camelCase.
- `toKebabCase`: Converts a string to kebab-case.
- `toSnakeCase`: Converts a string to snake_case.
- `toDotCase`: Converts a string to dot.case.
- `toPascalCase`: Converts a string to PascalCase.
- `toHeaderCase`: Converts a string to Header Case.
- `truncateString`: Truncates a string to a specified length. You have some options to customize the output and behavior.

### System

- `isBrowser`: Checks if the code is run in a browser.
- `isNode`: Checks if the code is run in NodeJS.

### Typeguards

- `isDefined`: Checks if a value is defined and not null / undefined / NaN.
- `isEmptyObject`: Checks if an object is empty.
- `isNumber`: Checks if any value is a number or can be parsed into a number.
- `isString`: Checks if any value is a string.

### Types

- `Primitive`: JS primitive types.
- `Nullish`: Only allows assignment of anything nullish.
- `NonNullish`: Allows assignment of anything except nullish values.
- `Mandatory`: Exclude nullish values from a type.
- `Nestable`: A type that can be nested infinitely. Used in deepEquals and arrIntersection functions.
- `GenericFunction`: A generic function type, useful for defining functions that accept any number of arguments and return any type. It's a stronger type than `Function`.
- `TypeOfString`: Strings which can be used with `typeof` operator.
- `TypeOfType`: Infer the `typeof` type from a `typeof` string.
- `UnionToIntersection`: Convert a union type (`|`) to an intersection type (`&`).
- `SmartPartial`: The keys that allow undefined are optional, the rest are required.
- `Simplify`: If two or more types are intersected, it simplifies them into a single type for better readability.
- `OverloadUnion`: Converts a union of functions into a single function with overloads.
- `ReadonlyDeep`: Typescripts readonly but for nested objects.
- `DeepPartial`: Typescripts partial but for nested objects.
